# Prog4

This is the partial submission for program 4 by Jack Grace

ellipsoids do not currently draw, but textures are drawn onto triangles with two separate modes of lighting (combine and replace), which can be toggled with the b key

I have used the Mozilla WebGL tutorials to help me complete this assignment. I used the tutorial simply to understand how to properly write the necessary code in most places, 
but in any places where I more directly used the provided code from the tutorial I have marked it as such in the program.
